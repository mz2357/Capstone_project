# Capstone_project
This project is a churn analysis for the weekly German newspaper "Die Zeit".

The main file is Capstone_main.ipynb, which contains EDA and model building.

The file Capstone_talk.pdf contains a talk on the results of this project (together with Sebastian Fuhrer).

The files Capstone_exp_engineering.ipynb and Capstone_exp_PCA.ipynb
contain some extra "experimental" material. 

Capstone_exp_engineering.ipynb constructs two new features and adds them to the models.
It also contains results obtained by using the voting or bagging classifier.

Capstone_exp_PCA.ipynb contains results on the best models of Capstone_main.ipynb, when one uses PCA for dimensionality reduction instead of the feture selection methods of Capstone_main.ipynb.

The folder Images contains image files and geojson files for the plots relating to the postal codes.
